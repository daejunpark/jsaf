interface A {
  getter DOMString toWord(unsigned long index);
};

/* Assume that an object implementing A has supported property indices
in the range 0 â‰¤ index < 2. Also assume that toWord is defined to
return its argument converted into an English word. The behavior when
invoking the operation with an out of range index is different from
indexing the object directly:

var a = getA();

a.toWord(0);  // Evalutes to "zero".
a[0];         // Also evaluates to "zero".

a.toWord(5);  // Evaluates to "five".
a[5];         // Evaluates to undefined, since there is no property "5".
