SAFE: Scalable Analysis Framework for ECMAScript Git Repository
---------------------------------------------------

This README exists in the top-level directory of the SAFE project.

If you have Git installed, you can clone the SAFE
repository by going to the directory in which you want to clone it
and issuing the following command:

    git clone ssh://yourid@plrg.kaist.ac.kr/var/git/jsaf SAFE

(The name "SAFE" merely specifies the name of the directory you want
to clone the code into.  Feel free to substitute another directory
name if you prefer.)

You'll now have a subdirectory named 'SAFE'.

Note that you need an account at the plrg.kaist.ac.kr server.

SETTING UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT
---------------------------

We assume you are using an operating system with a Unix-style shell
(for example, Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X, or Cygwin on Windows).  You
will need to have access to the following:

* J2SDK 1.6 or later.  See http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
* Ant 1.6.5 or later.  See http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
* Bash version 2.5 or later, installed at /bin/bash.
  See http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/

Assume JS_HOME points to the SAFE directory you checked out.  On
Unix-like systems this should be a matter of using export or setenv.  If
you are using Cygwin, one user reports success with the following
command line for setting JS_HOME:
  export JS_HOME=`cygpath -am cygwin/path/to/safe/install/directory`
e.g.:
  export JS_HOME=`cygpath -am ${HOME}/tools/safe`

In your shell startup script, add $JS_HOME/bin to your path.
The shell scripts in this directory are Bash scripts.  To run them,
you must have Bash accessible in /bin/bash.

Make sure the following environment variables are set in your startup
script:

    JAVA_HOME
    ANT_HOME

(Although our scripts are sometimes able to guess the locations of
JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME, it is preferred that you set them manually.)

Once all of these environment variables are set, build the framework
by going to the directory JS_HOME and typing the command:

    ./ant clean compile

Once you have built the framework, you can call it from any directory,
on any JavaScript file, simply by typing one of the following commands
at a command line:

    bin/jsaf parse somefile.js
    bin/jsaf help

TEST PROGRAMS
-------------

The directory tests/parser_tests/ contains some JavaScript programs
to test the parser.  Test programs that are supposed to fail to be
parsed have names that are prefixed with XXX.

The directory tests/not_passing_yet/ contains some JavaScript
programs that should pass, but do not.  For example, if we had a test
file containing an error that should be detected, but it isn't, that
would be contained in ProjectFortress/not_passing_yet with a name
prefixed with XXX.  Test programs in this directory should pass
the parser.

You can run parser tests by:

    ant testParser

and test one parser test by:

    bin/jsaf parse [-out dumped] tests/parser_tests/fundecl1.js

CLONE DETECTOR
--------------

To build the clone detector, type the following command:
    ant buildJSCD

To run the clone detector, type the following command:
    bin/jscd.sh

The clone configuration is located in the file
    bin/jscd_config
